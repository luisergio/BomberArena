# BomberArena
A version of the Bomber Man game.

The goal with that project is refactory a C# version created on college.

  ## Refactory Phases
  
  The refactory will have five phases:
  
  1) Translate from C# to Java **(I'm currently here)**
  
      The first step is just translate the code for Java 8 with Spring Boot.
      
  2) Unit Tests
  
      In that phase we will delivery unit tests to ensure that any refactory did't broke the project.
    
  3) Web FrontEnd
  
      To make the game playable, here I will use Angular to delivery a Web FrontEnd.
  
  4) Archtecture
  
      The goal here will be use SOLID and Design Patterns (when one of they turn out to be a good idea) to improve perfomance and maintenance.
  
  5) Update Java Version
  
      Update the Java version from 8 to 14.
