# BomberArena
A version of the Bomber Man game.

The goal with that project is refactory a C# version created on college.

  ## Refactory Phases
  
  The refactory will have five phases:

  1) ~~Translate from C# to Java~~ Create from Scratch **(I'm currently here, ...)**
  
      The C # Code was coupling the visual behavior with the game rules. So start over, just using the C# code as a guide, was a better decision.
      
  2) Unit Tests **(...here, ...)**
  
      Delivery code today without unit test became impossible.
    
  3) Web FrontEnd
  
      To make the game playable, here I will use Angular to delivery a Web FrontEnd.
  
  4) Archtecture **(...and here.)**
  
      The goal here will be use SOLID and Design Patterns (when one of they turn out to be a good idea) to improve perfomance and maintenance.
  
  5) Update Java Version
  
      Update the Java version from 8 to 14.
