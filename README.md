# BomberArena
An alternative version of the classic Bomber Man game.

The goal of this project is to refactor a C# version created while I was in college.

  ## Refactory Phases
  
  The refactory will be divided in five phases:

  1) ~~Translate from C# to Java~~ Create from Scratch **(I'm currently here, ...)**
  
      The C# Code was coupling the visual behavior with the game rules. To make the development easier, start over just using the C# code as a guide, become a better decision.
      
  2) Unit Tests **(...here, ...)**
  
      Delivery code today without unit test became impossible.
    
  3) Web FrontEnd
  
      To make the game playable, here I will use Angular to delivery a Web FrontEnd.
  
  4) Archtecture **(...and here.)**
  
      The goal here will be use SOLID and Design Patterns (when one of they turn out to be a good idea) to improve perfomance and maintenance.
  
  5) Update Java Version
  
      Update the Java version from 8 to 14.
